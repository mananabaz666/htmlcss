    Lucille Ball was an American actress and pioneer in comedy. She was the star of the popular television series, I Love Lucy. As an entertainer and businesswoman,
     Ball continuously broke barriers for women in entertainment business.
Lucille Ball was born on August 6, 1911 in Jamestown, New York. Her father died early on, leaving Ballâ€™s mother a widow. Eventually, her mother remarried. By the age of 12,
Ball knew that she loved being on stage. She enrolled in many acting classes and in 1925, her mother sent her to John Murray Anderson School for Dramatic Arts. There she trained under
popular teachers and one of her classmates was future Hollywood star, Bette Davis. Unfortunately, Ball did not enjoy her time at the school and the teachers believed that she lacked talent.

      She did not let the opinions of others stop her. Ball started working as a model in 1932, but she was never able to keep steady work. In 1933,
       she moved to Hollywood, California. For the next few years, Ball held small roles in several motion pictures. During this time, she also worked in theatre. In 1940,
       while working on movie set, she met Desi Arnaz, a Cuban American actor. The couple started dating immediately and eloped only a year later. They proved to be a powerful couple.
        Their relationship was the inspiration behind a television show created by Ball.
