    Robin Williams, in full Robin McLaurin Williams, (born July 21, 1951, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died August 11, 2014, Tiburon, California), American comedian and actor
    known for his manic stand-up routines and his diverse film performances. He won an Academy Award for his role in Good Will Hunting (1997).

Williams’s father, Robert, was an executive for the Ford Motor Company, and his mother was a former fashion model. He early learned to use humour to entertain classmates and was
a fan of comedian Jonathan Winters. When he was 16, his father retired, and the family moved to the San Francisco area. Williams studied political science at Claremont Men’s College
(now Claremont McKenna College), where he began taking courses in improvisation. He then attended the College of Marin to study acting but later received a scholarship to study at the Juilliard
School in New York City. Williams eventually moved back to California, where he began appearing in comedy clubs in the early 1970s.

By the mid-1970s Williams was guest starring on several television shows, including The Richard Pryor Show and Laugh-In. After guest appearances as the alien Mork on Happy Days, Williams was given his own show, Mork & Mindy (1978–82). The series offered Williams the opportunity to transfer the enthusiasm of his stand-up performances to the small screen and provided an outlet for his prolific improvisational talents. Mork & Mindy proved an immense success and was instrumental in launching Williams’s film career.
