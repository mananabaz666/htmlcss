    Chris Rock , (born February 7, 1966, Georgetown, South Carolina, U.S.), American comedian whose popular stand-up routine—which often addressed racial matters—led to a successful film career.

Rock grew up in the impoverished Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York. After dropping out of high school at 17 (he later received a high-school-equivalency diploma),
Rock played small clubs in the New York area, where he was discovered by comedian-actor Eddie Murphy. After landing parts in Murphy’s film Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) and director Keenen
Ivory Wayans’s I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988), Rock got his big break by earning a spot in 1990 as a cast member of Saturday Night Live. He left the show in 1993 to join the Fox network’s
In Living Color, which was taken off the air shortly thereafter. After starring in and writing the script for the film CB4 (1993), he covered the 1996 presidential campaign for ABC’s Politically
Incorrect. Rock then appeared in the first of his HBO comedy specials, Big Ass Jokes (1994), which won a CableACE Award. Soon after, however, Rock found his popularity as an actor and comedian
beginning to fade.

In an effort to reignite his career, Rock went on the road in 1996, playing small clubs. There he honed his comedic repertoire, touching on subjects that were often considered taboo,
 such as race relations, drug addiction, and Black poverty, all the while revealing the humorous aspects of some of the more serious, painful truths of the Black experience. Bolstered by the
 positive reaction he received while touring, Rock once again appeared in an HBO special, Bring the Pain (1997), which won two Emmy Awards and brought Rock widespread fame and critical acclaim.
 Riding the crest of his newfound popularity, Rock went on to star in the television series The Chris Rock Show (1997–2000), write the best-selling book Rock This! (1997), costar in the film Lethal
 Weapon 4 (1998), and provide the voice for Rodney the guinea pig in another Murphy movie, Dr. Dolittle (1998).
