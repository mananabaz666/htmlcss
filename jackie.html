    Jackie Chan, originally Chan Kong-sang, (born April 7, 1954, Hong Kong), Hong Kong-born Chinese stuntman, actor, and director whose perilous acrobatic stunts and
    engaging physical humour made him an action-film star in Asia and helped to bring kung fu movies into the mainstream of American cinema.

Chan was born to impoverished parents in Hong Kong. The family moved to Canberra, Australia, when Chan was six, but the following year his parents sent him back to Hong Kong to attend a
strict boarding school that trained students for jingxi. From age 7 to 17 he studied acrobatics, singing, martial arts, and mime—skills that launched him into a position with a professional
tumbling troupe and landed him bit roles as a child actor and, later, as a stuntman. The independent film producer Lo Wei, hoping to find a successor to the late Bruce Lee, cast him in a series
of lacklustre kung fu movies in 1976–78. Rather than ape Lee’s gritty persona, in 1978 Chan utilized his own form of bumbling physical comedy in his first successful films, She xing diao shou
(Snake in the Eagle’s Shadow) and Zui quan (Drunken Master). He then wrote and directed as well as starred in Xiao quan guai zhao (1979; The Fearless Hyena).

Chan retained complete creative control for Shi di chu ma (1980; The Young Master), his debut with the production company Golden Harvest, which he subsequently helped transform into Hong Kong’s
largest movie conglomerate. In the early 1980s, at the time when he was making an unsuccessful foray into English-language cinema, he moved beyond traditional martial arts period movies to modern
action-adventure films, such as ‘A’ jihua (1983; Project A) and Jing cha gu shi (1985: Police Story), along with their sequels. The films showcased his directorial talent for fight and stunt
choreography. His own stunts were often extraordinarily dangerous; he nearly perished from a fall in Lung hing foo dai (1986; Armour of God) that fractured his skull and impaired his hearing.
