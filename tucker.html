    Christopher Tucker, popularly known as Chris Tucker, is an American actor, stand-up comedian and humanist. Tucker would perform in front of his friends, family members and he even took part in talent competitions while in school. His classmates gave him the Most Humorous Prize for his performances. Being inspired by Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor and Robin Harris in movies and television, he decided to take up comedy as his career. Tucker moved to Los Angeles at the age of 19 to establish himself as a comedian and stayed in his friend’s living room floor. After performing locally he got the opportunity to showcase his talent as a stand-up comedian in Def Comedy Jam HBO television series. He was appreciated for not using any swearing word or talking about race or sex explicitly while entertaining. Tucker has acted in films like ‘House Party111’, ‘Friday’, ‘Dead Presidents’, ‘The Fifth Element’ and ‘Money Talks’ and is predominantly famous for his role as detective James Carter in the box office smash hits like Rush Hour, Rush Hour 2 and Rush Hour 3.
